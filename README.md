# LORA-Mesh_Driver
 LoRa driver for the SX1276 with mesh networking support on the Raspberry Pi, including source files and a build script

Set up multiple Raspberry Pi nodes, each equipped with an SX1276 LoRa module.
Load the module on each node using modprobe.
Send test packets between the nodes and check if they are routed properly based on the mesh network logic implemented in the driver.
Monitor routing and transmission logs via dmesg.



Future Work
The current implementation is basic and serves as a framework for further development. Next steps could include:

Implementing real SPI communication with the SX1276 using the Raspberry Piâ€™s SPI interface.
Developing more advanced mesh routing algorithms (e.g., AODV, BATMAN).
Adding support for node discovery and dynamic routing table updates.
Implementing low-power modes for energy-efficient operation.
This driver code is a starting point for a more advanced mesh-enabled LoRa network on Raspberry Pi using the SX1276 LoRa module.
